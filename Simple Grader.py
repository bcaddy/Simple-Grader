    Short Description: Accelerate the grading process of assignments fomr Courseweb
    Long Description:8
        This utility is used to accelerate an instructor's grading process. Reads in a single
        csv file from courseweb.

        -The user inputs an assignment to be graded and the grading range
        -then the user can search through the students and assign them a grade
        -the program automatically detects duplicates, will warn the user if the grade
            is outside the grade range or if the grade already exists
        -and finally all the unassigned (NaN) grades are set to zero
        -then the user can either grade another assignment or quit and save the csv
    Dependencies:
        - pandas
        - numpy
